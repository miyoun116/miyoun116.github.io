        <h1>Moscato Wine</h1>
        <h2>What is Moscato Wine?</h2>
        <p>Moscato (pronounced mo-ska-toh) is a sweet Italian wine known for its fruity notes. Made from the Muscat grape, this white wine is typically thought of as a dessert wine with a hint of fizz. Though there’s some variation between the different types, Moscato generally has a pretty low alcohol content, hovering around 5-7%. As a point of reference, most red wines have an alcohol content of about 10-12% ABV. The low alcohol content makes Moscato a great dessert drink for casual sipping, or the perfect addition to a brunch-time spritzer that won’t derail your entire day.</p>
        
        <h2>Moscato Wine Styles</h2>
        <h3>1. Moscato d’Asti</h3>  
        <p>This is the most common type of Moscato wine. It’s white, sweet and slightly sparkling (what’s known as “frizzante”), and made from the Muscat Blanc grape.</p>
        <h3>2. Asti Spumante</h3>  
        <p> The fully sparkling version of Moscato, Asti Spumante (or simply Asti) is the Muscat Blanc grape’s answer to champagne.</p>
        <h3>3. Pink Moscato</h3>  
        <p> Pink Moscato a delightful variation on the wine, featuring white Moscato wine made from the Muscat Blanc grape, plus a dash of Merlot for good measure.</p>
        <h3>4. Red Moscato</h3>  
        <p> Made with black and orange Muscat grapes, Red Moscato is the best of both worlds as far as red versus white wine is concerned. </p>
        <h3>5. Still Moscato</h3>  
        <p> This Moscato comes without the wine’s signature sparkle, and uses either the Zibibbo or the Muscat Blanc grape. </p>
        <h3>6. Dessert Moscato</h3>  
        <p> Though all Moscatos are quite sweet and have a reputation as a great dessert wine, this oak-aged style is commonly associated with wine made from Moscatel grapes. </p>
