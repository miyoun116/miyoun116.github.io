                    <h1>Hi, I am Miyoun Cho.</h1>
                    <h1>A product designer based in SF Bay Area.</h1>
                    <p>I recently received my masterâ€™s degree in Interaction and UI/UX Design from the Academy of Art University in San Francisco, where I completed a thesis titled "Doodle Lingo" with honors. <br/> <br/>
                        During my UX Design/Research Internship at KAIST, I gained practical experience in conducting user research, identifying user needs, and creating user-centered apps. I also honed my UI/UX design skills as a UI/UX Design Intern at Intoit, where I worked on the company's website, brand imagery, and animations.<br />
                        Before becoming a product designer, I had five years of experience in the healthcare industry as
                        a registered nurse in Korea.<br/> <br/>
                        I have been fortunate to experience various cultures by living in four different countries:
                        Korea, the US, the UK, and Germany. Those experiences have given me a lot of inspiration and
                        ideas for my work. In addition, this also helps me design for multi-national and cross-cultural
                        interactions.<br/> <br/>
                        I like to take care of plants and flowers in my garden. The smell of soil and leaves in the sun
                        gives me energy, and I love watching my plants grow. Sometimes I meet squirrels who visit my
                        garden to eat the fruits, and this gives me more pleasure in my garden.
