                    <h2> Summary </h2>
                    <p> Doodle Lingo is an educational app that provides fun ways for children to learn English. By combining drawing with language learning, children visually understand and memorize the language more easily. Children will create drawings that they can play with while practicing new vocabulary and sentences.</p>

                        <p>My son was born in Korea, but we moved to the U.S. when he was 11 months old. We also lived in Germany for two years. From this experience, I learned how challenging it is to learn a second and third language. That motivated me to create my final thesis project around this challenge.</p>

                    <h2> Designing for Kids: Touch Gestures </h2>
                    <p>For designing an app for young children, I needed to learn their physical abilities. Children
                        under 5 have limited motor skills and require very simple physical interactions on touchscreens.
                        In addition, children between 6-8 years old can perform simple trackpad and keyboard usage but
                        is still constrained.
                        Based on the research, I decided to create touchscreen designs emphasizing swiping, tapping, and
                        dragging which are the simplest and most appropriate gestures for young users.

                    <h2> Designing for Kids: Cognitive, Language, and Fine Motor Skills Development </h2>
                    <p>For defining my target audience, I needed to better understand child development.
                        Based on the common development milestones, 4- to 5-year-old children Know how to sort and
                        classify object according to more complex characteristics and put together four to five words
                        into a sentence. At this age, children can draw geometric shapes and tracing on a line with
                        control.

                        Because of this reason, <span style="color:#FC423F">the minimum age of the target audience is 4</span>, because at the age of 4,
                        children have adequate cognitive abilities and fine motor skills to use mobile apps. <br>
                        From the target audience interview, I learned that from the ages of 4-7, children are much more familiar with visuals than text, so Doodle Lingo can be a great English learning tool for them.</p>

                        skills as well as their English abilities through drawing and various interactive activities
                        that the app provides.<br/>

Over 81% people had experiences to use language learning apps. Also, commonly used gestures are “click” and “drag and drop” so, I incorporated both into Doodle Lingo, not only because they are the most common, but also the most conducive to young children. Target audiences required “easy to use interfaces” and “new and interesting graphics” for children’s apps. I planned to focus on creating simple interfaces and cheerful characters and game screens to make the app useful and kid friendly.The most popular topics for children were vehicles and animals. I decided to include these in the main topic of the app.</p>

Yoonchae lives in Korea, and uses language learning apps to help her learn Korean and English. However, sometimes she gets confused with the logistics of the app, how to go to the next step, or navigate its functions. Seungwoo enjoys playing games with various apps. Especially, he likes to customize his characters and animate them to resemble real life. Sehun is always speaking Korean with his family, so speaking English with his friends at school is a challenging switch. He needs to learn English in a fun and effective way to fit in with his friends at school.

                    <p>I was inspired by these two apps. My son like drawing pictures, so we have been using Bini Bambini a lot, which is an interactive drawing app. He also likes the Todo Math app that provides interactive games to learn math. My son really wanted to find an app like Todo Math for English.<br>
                    From these experiences, I thought that an app that combines drawing and interactive games could make learning the language more effective and fun.

                    <p>At the beginning of this project, I sketched out my ideas to visually present them to others. At this time, I focused on creating layouts for each page and thinking about how the content would flow for performing each task. I utilized the three task flows to help my logic, and it was a great way to begin thinking about the functionality and design of Doodle Lingo.</p>

                    <p>I created hand-drawn sketches of each page and quickly realized that paper wireframes would not
                        be able to fully demonstrate the mobile interfaces and interactions. For this reason, I created
                        low-fidelity wireframe using digital prototyping tools for user tests. The first tool I used was
                        Adobe XD, which is simple, easy to use, and my most familiar tool at the time. I created
                        wireframes and printed them out as paper prototypes for the first round of user tests. They were
                        ultimately very useful for understanding the pay layouts and the interface design but were not
                        sufficient to demonstrate interaction design.</p>

                        Illustration for detailed graphics on the game background and characters. Digital prototypes
                        using Figma were very helpful for demonstrating not only the interface design but also
                        interaction designs, so I opted for this in user testing.</p>

                    <p>Throughout this project, I was able to experience various design and development processes. Since
                        this project is for children, understanding target audiences’ needs through target audience
                        interviews were critical to improving the project concept targeted toward children. Designing
                        quiz games to make them not only enjoyable but also helpful in terms of educational value was a
                        challenge for me. However, many rounds of iterative user testing helped me improve interaction
                        and interface design. Through user testing, I found out that this project concept helped
                        children engage in learning English actively and enjoyably. I look forward to publishing the
                        Doodle Lingo App to online mobile app stores, so people can really download and play it in the
                        future.</p>
